# DOC-0003: Troubleshooting - Offline Mode

**Emergency Protocol**: What to do when the internet dies.

## Status: 🔴 OFFLINE
You will see a **Red Bar** at the top of the screen: "No Connection - Saving to Device".

### ✅ DO (Keep Working)
1.  **Keep taking orders.** The system saves everything to the iPad's memory.
2.  **Keep printing.** Printers talk to the POS via LAN, not the Internet.
3.  **Inform Customers**: "Credit Card / QR Payment might be slow. Cash is preferred."

### ❌ DO NOT
1.  **Do NOT Log out.** You cannot log back in without internet.
2.  **Do NOT Clear Cache.** This will delete the saved orders!

## How to Fix

### Step 1: Check the Router
- Is the router light blinking red?
- Restart the Router (Unplug -> Count to 10 -> Plug in).

### Step 2: Use Hotspot Backup
- If Fiber is down, turn on "Personal Hotspot" on the Manager Phone.
- Connect the main POS iPad to the Hotspot.

### Step 3: Force Sync
- Once the "Green Dot" appears (Online):
- Go to **Settings > Data Sync**.
- Tap **Sync Now**.
- Wait until "Pending Orders" shows **0**.
